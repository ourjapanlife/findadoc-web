Welcome to Find a Doc, Japan! We're grateful for our volunteers 😊

We are working on the V2 version of the site, so if you've volunteered in the past, you might notice things look a little different.

# Where should I start?

👉️ Join us on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/find-a-doc/shared_invite/zt-s4744a6o-MGaGHzLN5wB9aXeha3vdsQ)! 💬

👉 Is this your first Open-source project? Please check out our [beginner resources]( https://github.com/ourjapanlife/findadoc-web/wiki/Getting-Started-with-Open-Source-%F0%9F%94%B0) to learn the basics of Git and GitHub 💕

👉️ Developers 💻️

1. Fork the repo and build the source by following the [README](./README.md)
2. Find a good issue by checking out the [Issues Section](https://github.com/ourjapanlife/findadoc-web/issues). PLEASE only take tickets with the `help wanted` label.
3. For new developers looking for easier tickets, look for an unassigned issue tagged `Good First Issue`.
4. Create your own branch and start writing your code!  (we recommend prefixing your branch with your username, like `coolgithubname/mychange`) 
5. Submit a PR (Pull Request) on Github and work with the team to merge it. Make sure that all automated checks and linters pass, and please add a clear description of what you did and how you test it.
6. Give us a shout if you need any help on the `#frontend-team` channel on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/find-a-doc/shared_invite/zt-s4744a6o-MGaGHzLN5wB9aXeha3vdsQ)!

We use the [All Contributors Bot](https://allcontributors.org/) to celebrate various contributions to our project, from coding to design to research, translation, and more.! This project would not be possible without many talented folks collaborating. Read more about [how to use the bot here](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/bot/usage).
